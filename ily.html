        <h1>Happy Valentine's Day</h1>
        <p>If you thought the note was it, then you're mistaken. I just couldn't write all my feelings out on paper like you.</p>
        <p>Kaylee, I love you so much. I'm beyond happy that you're here for me. You mean the world to me, and I cherish every moment we spend together. I admire how you're not scared to be yourself around meâ€”it's one of the many things that make you so special. Your sweetness and cuteness brighten my day, and I feel incredibly lucky to have you by my side. You're always there for me, and I promise I'll never let you down!</p>
        <p>From the moment we met, I knew there was something incredibly special about you. Your laughter is like music to my ears, and your smile lights up even the darkest days. I love the way you always know how to cheer me up and make everything better. You're my rock, my confidante, and my best friend.</p>
        <p>Every little thing you do makes me fall deeper in love with you. Whether it's the way you scrunch your nose when you're thinking or how you always manage to find the perfect words to say, you're perfect in every way. I couldn't imagine my life without you, and I don't want to. Thank you for being you, for being with me, and for loving me just as I am.</p>
        <p>As we continue this journey together, I promise to stand by your side through thick and thin. I'll always be here to support you, to lift you up when you need it, and to celebrate all the wonderful moments we share. You make my heart full, and I am forever grateful for the love we have.</p>
        <p>Happy Valentine's Day, My Baby.<br> -Nick</p>
